/**
 * Card component representing a blog post with image,
 * title, author, date, and content.
 *
 *
 * Card Component Guidelines:
 * When creating a new Card component, adhere to the following guidelines:
 *  - **Width and Max-Width**: Avoid setting width or max-width within the Card
 * component, as these values will be determined by the parent component or section
 * for better flexibility in layout design.
 *  - **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and
 * provide a clear structure to the content within the Card component.
 *  - **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the Card component is responsive, adapting to
 * various screen sizes and devices for a seamless user experience.
 *  - **Theme Compatibility**: If the application has theme configurations, ensure
 * that the styles in the Card component are compatible with different themes,
 * maintaining a consistent and visually appealing design.
 *
 * Use Case Stories:
 *  - **Single Card View**: Utilize the Card component to display a single blog
 * post in a full-width container, emphasizing the content's importance.
 *  - **Grid Card View**: Arrange multiple Card components in a responsive grid
 * layout, providing an organized and visually appealing presentation of blog posts.
 *  - **Carousel View**: Implement a carousel or slider to showcase multiple Card
 * components in a rotating manner, offering a dynamic and engaging user experience.
